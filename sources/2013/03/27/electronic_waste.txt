Take Responsibilty
####################
That's what you have to do since you are reading this post you have some
electronic device. Sooner or later the end of life of your device will be
reached, hopefully you bought already in the thought of this event some high
quality product and are using it until it's real end, and then you need to take
responsibility, don't sell it for a few euros on some flea market or in the
internet, except the person which is buying is really going to use it. 
Because if you don't do that, it most probably goes to africa and you can have a
look what is going to happen then on this_ youtube video. So don't close your
eyes and behave like it is non of your business since it was you bought the
gadget.
