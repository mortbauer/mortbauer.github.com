                &lt;p&gt;I hope you agree with me that eating, and therefore food and places
where to eat are very important, but actually also the opportunities
for good and affordable food differ a lot from country to country,
from city to city and even from university to university. Obviously it
isn&amp;#8217;t very objective to judge about good, or delicious food as it
depends on one&amp;#8217;s flavour. You it isn&amp;#8217;t a very easy subject, but an
important one, and as I also really like to eat, I will start my first
blog about the food at the university, I hope a lot more will&amp;nbsp;follow.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
