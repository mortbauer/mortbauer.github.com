{% mark excerpt %}

I hope you agree with me that eating, and therefore food and places
where to eat are very important, but actually also the opportunities
for good and affordable food differ a lot from country to country,
from city to city and even from university to university. Obviously it
isn't very objective to judge about good, or delicious food as it
depends on one's flavour. You it isn't a very easy subject, but an
important one, and as I also really like to eat, I will start my first
blog about the food at the university, I hope a lot more will follow.

## Ravintola Newton

Which means, restaurant **Newton**, was the first restaurant I
became to know, because it was also the only one opened in the first week.
