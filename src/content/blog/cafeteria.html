{% mark excerpt %}
I hope you agree with me that eating, and therefore food and places
where to eat are very important, but actually also the opportunities
for good and affordable food differ a lot from country to country,
from city to city and even from university to university. Obviously it
isn't very objective to judge about good, or delicious food as it
depends on one's flavour. You it isn't a very easy subject, but an
important one, and as I also really like to eat, I will start my first
blog about the food at the university, I hope a lot more will follow.

Actually there is not only one good place to eat the Tampere University of
Technology TUT, no there are at least three, no four which should be mentioned.
This are Ravintola Newton, Ravintola is the Finnish word for Restaurant, then
there is Ravintola Zip and Ravintola Edison. This restaurants serve, of course
depending on ones taste, very delicious food, from about 10.30 to 15.00 every
weekday, and on Saturday one can still go to Ravintola Edison as it is the only
one opened also on Saturdays.
