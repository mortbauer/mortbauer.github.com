For a while now my blog is completely empty, for one reason that's because I
was to lazy to create any content and for the other because I still hadn't
found the right tool for that job, since I don't like WYSIWYG very much and I'm
a huge fan of python_ and restructuredText_ it needed to be something with both
of them, I already had tried hyde_, django_ and flask_ but all of them were a
bit to much work for some individual styled and well behaved blog, (I nearly
forgot that I also wanted a cheap hosting, so now dynamic website). Hopefully
tinkerer_ is a better solution now.
