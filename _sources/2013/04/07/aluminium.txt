If you haven't seen that yet, then watch it now, here is a link_ to the video,
you can watch the trailer for free, and rent the whole movie for three euros,
it is worth the small amount of money totally. The film is about the harmful
side of Aluminium on the human organism, from causing cancer to Alzheimer and
allergies. A typical answer might be, that is all nonsense and just some
conspiracy theory, but there are serious scientists who are speaking in the
movie and statistics which have hard facts behind so give it a chance, but in
the end it is your health if you don't give a shit about it is your problem
since I'm not giving a shit about your health ;) .

Watch it!
