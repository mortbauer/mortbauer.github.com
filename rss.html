<h1>Take Responsibilty</h1>
<p>That’s what you have to do since you are reading this post you have some
electronic device. Sooner or later the end of life of your device will be
reached, hopefully you bought already in the thought of this event some high
quality product and are using it until it’s real end, and then you need to take
responsibility, don’t sell it for a few euros on some flea market or in the
internet, except the person which is buying is really going to use it.
Because if you don’t do that, it most probably goes to africa and you can have a
look what is going to happen then on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A5zVNpkuzk">this</a> youtube video. So don’t close your
eyes and behave like it is non of your business since it was you bought the
gadget.</p>

<h1>New Blog with Tinkerer</h1>
<p>For a while now my blog is completely empty, for one reason that’s because I
was to lazy to create any content and for the other because I still hadn’t
found the right tool for that job, since I don’t like WYSIWYG very much and I’m
a huge fan of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">python</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">restructuredText</a> it needed to be something with both
of them, I already had tried <a class="reference external" href="http://ringce.com/hyde">hyde</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com">django</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org">flask</a> but all of them were a
bit to much work for some individual styled and well behaved blog, (I nearly
forgot that I also wanted a cheap hosting, so now dynamic website). Hopefully
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tinkerer.me">tinkerer</a> is a better solution now.</p>
